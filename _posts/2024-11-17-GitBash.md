After installing Git Bash open the terminal and configure your **Git Identity**:

- [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads)


```
git config --global user.name "Fran.Dujmovic"
```

```
git config --global user.email "Fran.Dujmovic@vertiv.com"
```

This will setup your Git account and connect it to your official work email. In order to clone GitLab repos via SSH encryption you will need to generate an **SSH key**. If you want to skip configuring a password, simply press "Enter" and leave it blank and in the default location.

```
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "fran.dujmovic@vertiv.com"
```

This will generate an SSH key which you will you as a verification method via GitLab. To **view** your generated SSH key input the following command;

```
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

The SSH key will look like the following:

	ssh-rsa [SSH_KEY] fran.dujmovic@vertiv.com

Copy and paste the SSH key into '**SSH Keys**' section of your GitLab profile. You should get a confirmation email that an SSH key was added into your GitLab account.
