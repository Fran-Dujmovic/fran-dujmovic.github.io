Download and install the official installation package for Visual Studio Code:

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

To check what version you have installed, copy and paste this into a terminal of your choosing:

```
code --version
```

After you open VS Code for the first time, you should install the recommended extensions:

- [Python](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python)
- [Docker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-docker)

Alternatively, you can install them via the integrated **VS Code GUI** (left side bar). The **Python** extension manages the console integration for Ignition scripting and Gateway communication, while the **Docker** extension allows for image, container and registry creation and management (as well as volume dependencies).

If you run the Docker commands from the Docker guide in your VS Code terminal (**Terminal > New Terminal**), VS Code should detect your pull request and automatically download the image and create the container for you.

To check which Docker Version you have installed, use the following command:

```
docker --version
```

For testing purposes, you can pull a '*Hello-World*' image:

```
docker run hello-world
```

Listed below are some general terminal commands you can run through VS Code. For all intents and purposes, it is recommended to use the integrated VS Code terminal for all communication between containers, scripts and gateways (especially while using **Docker Compose**):

List all containers and their IDs
```
docker ps -a 
```

Stop a container
```
docker stop [CONTAINER_ID]
```

Remove a container
```
docker rm [CONTAINER_ID]
```

List all images
```
docker images
```

Remove an image
```
docker rmi [IMAGE_ID]
```


## Clone GitLab Repo using VS Code

VS Code allows for **GitHub/GitLab integration**, **repository cloning** and **push/pull requests** directly through the code editor.
In order to clone a GitLab repo into your VS Code locally use the following command through **VS Code terminal**:

```
cd path/to/directory
git clone [HTTPS_CLONE_URL]
```

The `path/to/directory` segment is your local path file - in other words, where you want the repository to be cloned.
An example where this can be used is if you want to clone a **GitHub repository** during the **Ignition SDK Module development process**.

Alternatively, you can also specify the destination in the command line interface itself:

```
git clone [HTTPS_CLONE_URL] [DESTINATION_FOLDER]
```

Ignition's repository, training materials and core certification can be found here;

- [Ignition GitLab](https://gitlab.com/vertiv-co/switchgear/ems/training/ignition/IGN_Training)

The example below shows the process of cloning the  `IGN_Training` folder into a local folder of your choosing on your PC (i.e. `#CLONED_REPOS\IGN_Training` ):

```
git clone https://gitlab.com/vertiv-co/switchgear/ems/training/ignition/IGN_Training.git "C:\Users\fran.dujmovic@OneDrive - Vertiv Co\Desktop\#VS_CODE\#CLONED_REPOS\IGN_Training"
```

You can choose to clone using the SSH encryption key you created previously via Git Bash or directly through the **HTTPS URL**.
